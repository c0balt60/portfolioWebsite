I was asked to participate in an up-coming simulator game called "Bomb Simulator".
I was tasked with programming the whole game including:
- Bombs
- The Shop
- Progression System ( Walls that players have to break through )
- User Interface programming

Unfortunately, the game fizzled out due to poor management.
