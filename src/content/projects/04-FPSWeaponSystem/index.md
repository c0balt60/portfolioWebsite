I always wanted to develop my very own weapons engine on Roblox. I have tried many times, but I couldn't get the hang of it.
Until now of course, I will be showing you the full system ðŸ˜Š

### Basic Overview

This weapon system works with a multitude of weapons, my main goal for this project was to replace the old ACS engine, as it is hard to work with and edit.
The engine features the following settings:
- Using Ammo
- Explosive rounds
- Shotguns
- Rocket projectiles
- Snipers
- Toggle Modes ( Semi, Auto, Burst )
